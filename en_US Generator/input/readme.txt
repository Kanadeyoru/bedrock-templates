Your blocks and items .json files should be named the way you want to display their names in-game, for example:
1. If your block .json file was named 'my_cool_block.json' the name of the block in-game would be 'My Cool Block'
2. If your block .json file was named 'mycoolblock.json' the name of the block in-game would be 'Mycoolblock'

The same thing apply to items and entities.

Put your blocks or items folder from your BP here to create the list.
